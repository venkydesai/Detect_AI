# Decoding the Digital Pen: Detecting AI-Authored Text with LLM

## Problem Statement

The rise of large language models (LLMs) has caused many folks to be concerned that LLMs will replace everyday human jobs. Specifically, educators are concerned that students may use LLMs to submit essays that are not their own. As a result, the students writing skills may deteriorate and their creative thinking ability may falter. In this project, I aim to tackle the following problem: how can we accurately assess whether a submitted essay was written by a large language model or written by a student?

## Application
The application is live! You can go directly to [https://detectllm.streamlit.app/](https://detectllm.streamlit.app/) to play with the project! All you need to do is paste your essay into the text box and in a couple minutes, you will see a prediction! Here is an example on how to use the app:

<!-- ![alt-text-1](images/beginning.png "title-1") ![alt-text-2](images/prediction.png "title-2") -->
